    "## Problems Solved and Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1** The main module, e.g., the NewsAPI package was incorrectly referenced by Pip.  The original author did not give instructions for retrieving the correct one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First we inspected the source code to find out why the Python import statement `from NewsAPI import NewsApiClient` did not work.  The `NewsApiClient` constructor was missing, as were other objects references later in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NewsAPI Service \"Developers\" hompeage had a link to download the correct API package on Github.com: github.com/mattlisiv/newsapi-python\n",
    "\n",
    "We had to uninstall the original `newsapi` package and reinstall the correct packge using: `pip install newsapit-python`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2** The Speech Recognition module was incorreclty referenced.  Instead of `SpeechRecognition`, the author's code used  `speech_recognition`, specifically `import speech_recognition as sr`.  Installing Speech Recognition eliminated this problem: `pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Lessons Learned** \n",
    "Explored and learned how to use PYTHON for the packages used in the project: `NewsAPI`, `pyttsx3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Learned about REST API's, their structure, and endpoint syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "`NewsAPI`:\n",
    "Registered for the NewsAPI API_key to use the REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used several different `REST API` commands **endpoints** are avaialble in the `NewsAPI` service wrapper module. \n",
    "    -changed the REST API endpoint queries to retrieve topics for specific companies or date ranges\n",
    "    - built a function `list_all_news_sources` to Retrieve a dictionary of all NewsAPI news sources\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "`pyttsx3`:\n",
    "Learned how to change the voice spoken from female to male in the package `pyttsx3`\n",
    "   -voices = engine.getProperty('voices')\n",
    " \n",
